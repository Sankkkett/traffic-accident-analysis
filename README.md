# 🚦 Traffic & Accident Analysis  
### *An end-to-end Data Analytics Project using SQL, Power BI & Excel*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **traffic patterns, vehicle counts, accident severity, and congestion trends** across different locations and time periods.  
Using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**, the goal is to uncover:

- Accident-prone zones  
- Peak traffic hours  
- Low-speed congestion pockets  
- High-risk locations  
- Speed & volume variation across locations  

This analysis supports **smart city planning, traffic optimization, and road safety improvements**.

# 📊 Dashboard Overview

### 🧭 1. Timestamp Filters  
Interactively explore traffic & accidents based on specific dates and times.

### 🗺 2. Map – Area / Latitude / Longitude  
Geographic plot showing traffic points across zones.

### 🚗 3. Vehicle Count by Location  
Identifies high-traffic and low-traffic spots (L1–L10).

### 🏎 4. Avg Speed by Zone  
Zone-wise comparison of speed patterns:
- Zone 1 & 2 → Higher speeds  
- Zone 3 → Congested zone  

### 📅 5. Daily Vehicle Count & Speed Trend  
Correlates traffic volume with speed fluctuations.

### 📘 6. Summary Table  
Total vehicle count, speed metrics, quarterly numbers.
